# Apple2-EMU

A simple Apple 2 Emulator written in C. This emulator has currently been tested with the Applesoft BASIC and the Apple 2 System Monitor.

## Building

Follow these steps in order to build the emulator (make sure SDL3 is installed first):

```bash
git clone 
cd Apple2-EMU
make clean & make
```

## Usage

The rom images for Applesoft and the System Monitor are already included in this repository under the /roms folder. All you need to do to use the emulator is run the following command:

```bash
./bin/apple2
```
